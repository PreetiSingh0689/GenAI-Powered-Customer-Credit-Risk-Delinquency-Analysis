# GenAI-Powered-Customer-Credit-Risk-Delinquency-Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer credit data to identify and predict
delinquency risk using data analytics and AI-driven techniques. The objective is
to help financial institutions proactively identify high-risk customers and
support better credit risk decision-making.

🎯 Business Objective
- Analyze customer demographic and financial data
- Identify key factors contributing to delinquency
- Predict the likelihood of customer delinquency
- Provide actionable insights for risk mitigation

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level credit information, including:
- Customer demographics (age, income, employment status)
- Loan details (loan amount, tenure, interest rate)
- Credit behavior (missed payments, late payments)
- Credit score and debt-to-income ratio
- Delinquency indicator (target variable)

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Power BI(visualization & dashboards)
- Machine Learning basics (risk prediction logic)
- Generative AI concepts (for insights & explanation support)

⚙️ Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature analysis to identify key risk drivers
4. Delinquency classification (high-risk vs low-risk customers)
5. Risk segmentation based on probability scores
6. Visualization of trends and risk patterns

🔍 Key insights backed by data

1. Risk concentrated in core working-age customers (40–60 years)
2. Higher outstanding balances (60K–100K) increased portfolio exposure
3. Missed payments (3+) emerged as the strongest early warning signal
4. Delinquency peaked in Month 5, aligned with a surge in missed payments
5. Avg credit utilization ~49%, while Python-predicted risk probabilities (~0.17) helped identify pre-delinquent customers for proactive monitoring
